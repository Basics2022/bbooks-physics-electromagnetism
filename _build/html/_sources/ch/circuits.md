# Circuit Approximation

**Electric Circuits**

- **Validity Conditions for Circuit Approximation:**
  - The dimensions of the circuit are much smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves involved.
  - The frequency of the signals is low enough that the propagation delay is negligible.
  - The electric and magnetic fields are confined within the circuit components.

- **Basic Components:** resistors (R); capacitors (C); inductors (L); voltage and current sources; switches; non-linear components: diodes, transistors,...

- **Operating Regimes:**
  - **Steady State (DC):** The circuit parameters (voltage, current) do not change over time.
  - **Harmonic (AC):** The circuit parameters vary sinusoidally with time.
  - **Transient:** The circuit parameters change over time, typically due to a change in input or initial conditions.

**Electromagnetic Circuits**

- **Validity Conditions for Circuit Approximation:**
  - term $\partial_t \vec{d}$ negligible,...**todo** *as an integral condition on a system? Discussion in terms of energy?*

- **Example: Transformers**
  - Transformers operate on the principle of electromagnetic induction.
  - They are used to step up or step down voltages and currents in AC circuits.
  - The circuit approximation is valid as long as the frequency of the AC signal is within the designed range of the transformer.

**Electro-Magneto-Mechanical Circuits**

- **Examples:**
  - **Simple Circuits:** Basic circuits involving electromagnetic and mechanical components, such as a moving coil in a magnetic field.
  - **Electric Motors:** Convert electrical energy into mechanical energy.
  - **Generators:** Convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - Interaction between electrical and mechanical components.
  - Energy conversion and efficiency.
  - Dynamic behavior and control of electromechanical systems.
