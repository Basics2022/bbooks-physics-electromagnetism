# Force, moments, energy and momentum in electromagnetism

In this section, forces and moments on charges immersed in an electromagnetic field and the energy and momentum of the electromagnetic field are discussed.

Total energy and momentum of a system involving electromagnetic phenomena has contributions from charges, currents and the electromagnetic field.

[**Forces, moments and power**](classical-electromagnetism:forces-moments). Forces and moments acting of elementary charge systems immersed in an electromagnetic field are evaluated and power of these actions are riscussed.

[**Energy and momentum balance equations of the electromagnetic field**](classical-electromagnetism:energy-momentum). Energy balance equation of the electromagnetic field
