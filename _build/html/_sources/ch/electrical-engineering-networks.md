# Network analysis

**Network analysis of linear circuits.** Parallel and series connections; **equivalent circuits**: Thevenin and Norton theorems, Millman's theorem; state-space representation in physical and transformed domains (typically Laplace for transient dynamics - e.g. response to change of state of switches -, and Fourier for periodic regimes - e.g. AC)

**Harmonic regime.** Analysis of networks in AC; state variables, network variables, and power.

**Three-phase circuits.** Three-phase circuits are introduced, along with some standard configurations (star and trinagles), and a general approach for the solution.
