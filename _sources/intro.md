[**Principles of classical electromagnetism**](classical-electromagnetism:principles). Principles of electromagnetism (charge conservation, Lorentz's force and Maxwell's equations) are first introduced for [electromagentic phenomena in free-space](classical-electromagnetism:principles:free-space), in both differential and integral form. Then, equations governing [electromagnetism in matter](classical-electromagnetism:principles:matter) are discussed: free charge and current are distinguished from bound charte and current, resulting from polarization and the magnetization of matter as a response to external fields are described, and introduced into the **constitutive equations** characterizing the behavior of matter. Integral form of governing equations is provided for both control volumes and arbitrary domains in motion w.r.t. the observer, and this description is used to introduce the [low-speed relativity](classical-electromagnetism:principles:low-speed-relativity) of physical quantities involved in electromagnetism.

[**Electromagentic potentials and wave equations**](classical-electromagnetism:waves). [Electromagnetic potentials](classical-electromagnetism:potentials) are introduced, along with gauge conditions. [Wave equations](classical-electromagnetism:waves:wave-equation) for physical quantities in electromagnetism are then introduced. [Plane waves](classical-electromagnetism:waves:plane-waves) are discussed along with interface phenomena like rifraction and reflecion.
