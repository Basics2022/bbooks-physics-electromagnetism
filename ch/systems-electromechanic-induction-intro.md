# Electromechanic systems: first examples with induction

In this section first examples of electromechanical systems converting mechanical and electromagnetic power and viceversa exploiting **electromagnetic induction** are discussed. These examples can be interpreted as rudimentary models of motors or generators. Electromagnetic induction is governed by Faraday's law

$$\begin{aligned}
  0 
  & = \oint_{\partial s_t} \vec{e}^* \cdot \hat{t} + \dfrac{d}{dt} \int_{s_t} \vec{b} \cdot \hat{n} = \\
  & = \oint_{\partial s_t} \vec{e}   \cdot \hat{t} +               \int_{s_t} \partial_t \vec{b} \cdot \hat{n}  \ ,
\end{aligned}$$

as derived from integral form of governing equations on arbitrary domain $s_t$ (**todo** *add link*), that can move in space, with the definition of

$$\vec{e}^* = \vec{e} - \vec{b} \times \vec{v}_b \ ,$$

and $\vec{v}_b$ is the velocity of the point of the boundary of the surface $\partial s_t$.
